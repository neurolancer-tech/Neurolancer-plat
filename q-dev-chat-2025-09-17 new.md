I understand. The conversation history has been cleared and I'm ready to help you with your Neurolancer AI Freelance Marketplace project. 

I can see from the pinned context that you have a Django backend and Next.js frontend setup. What would you like to work on today?

read:F:\neurolancercode\Neurolancer-plat\q-dev-chat-2025-09-17.md carefully understand what last agent was doing then continue where they left of on creating the full functional referal system

---

I can see from the chat history that the previous agent was working on implementing a comprehensive referral system. They had started creating the models, services, and views but the conversation was cut off while creating the frontend referral page. Let me continue from where they left off.

Let me first check what was already implemented and then complete the referral system:

---

Great! I can see that the referral system files were already created:
- `referral_models.py`
- `referral_service.py` 
- `referral_urls.py`
- `referral_views.py`

Let me check what was implemented and continue from there:

---

Great! The backend referral system is already well implemented. Now let me check if the models are imported and if we need to run migrations:

---

I can see the referral models are already imported. Now let me check if the URLs are properly configured:

---

Great! I can see the referral URLs are already included. Now let me check if we need to run migrations for the referral models:

---

Perfect! Now let me check if the registration views are updated to integrate referral processing:

---

I can see the registration view already has referral processing integrated. Let me check if the notification service has the referral notifications:

---

I can see the notification service is basic. Let me check if there's a more comprehensive one or if I need to update it. Let me also check the frontend structure to continue creating the referral page:

---

Great! I can see the referrals directory already exists. Let me check what's in the referral page:

---

Excellent! The referral page is already well implemented. Now let me check if the referral link is added to the navigation dropdown. Let me check the layout or navigation component:

---

I can see the navigation component but I don't see the referrals link in the dropdown menu. Let me add it to both the desktop dropdown and mobile navigation:

---

Adding referrals link to the user dropdown menu in desktop navigation

Now let me create the admin referral management page. Let me check if there's already an admin referrals page:
