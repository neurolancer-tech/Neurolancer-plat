# Custom Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive custom notification system that allows admins to send personalized messages to users through the support ticket system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Notification Service
- **File**: `backend/api/notification_service.py`
- **New Action**: `custom_reply` - Sends admin's custom message content directly to users
- **Functionality**: Allows full custom message content to be sent as notifications

### 2. Admin Custom Notification API
- **File**: `backend/api/admin_ticket_views.py`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/tickets/{ticket_id}/custom-notification/`
- **Function**: `send_custom_notification()`
- **Permissions**: Admin users only
- **Payload**: `{"message": "Custom notification content"}`

### 3. Admin Interface Enhancement
- **File**: `web/app/admin/reports/page.tsx`
- **New Modal**: Custom Reply & Notification modal
- **Features**:
  - Send regular ticket replies
  - Send custom notification messages
  - Dual-purpose interface for both reply and notification

### 4. URL Configuration
- **File**: `backend/api/urls.py`
- **New Route**: `admin/tickets/<int:ticket_id>/custom-notification/`
- **Integration**: Properly integrated with existing admin ticket management

## How It Works

### Backend Flow
1. Admin accesses ticket management interface
2. Selects "Custom Reply" option for any ticket
3. Can send both:
   - Regular reply (stored in ticket replies)
   - Custom notification (sent directly to user's notifications)
4. Custom notifications use `custom_reply` action type
5. Full message content is preserved and sent to user

### Frontend Flow
1. Admin clicks message icon next to ticket
2. Modal opens with two text areas:
   - Reply Message (required)
   - Custom Notification Message (optional)
3. Both messages are sent via separate API calls
4. User receives notifications for both actions

### Notification Types
- **Regular Reply**: "Support Response: {ticket_id}" - Contains reply preview
- **Custom Notification**: "Support Update: {ticket_id}" - Contains full custom message

## API Endpoints

### Send Custom Notification
```
POST /api/admin/tickets/{ticket_id}/custom-notification/
Authorization: Admin required
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Your custom notification message here"
}
```

### Send Regular Reply
```
POST /api/admin/tickets/{ticket_id}/reply/
Authorization: Admin required
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Your reply message here"
}
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Custom Notification API
- ✅ **PASS** - API endpoint working correctly
- ✅ Custom notification created in database
- ✅ Proper message content preserved
- ✅ Correct notification type assigned

### Test 2: Regular Reply with Notification
- ✅ **PASS** - Reply API working correctly
- ✅ Reply notification created
- ✅ Proper integration with existing system

## Database Impact
- **Notifications Table**: New entries with `notification_type='support'`
- **Ticket Replies Table**: Regular replies stored separately
- **No Schema Changes**: Uses existing notification infrastructure

## Security Features
- Admin-only access via `IsAdminUser` permission
- Input validation for message content
- Proper error handling and responses
- Integration with existing authentication system

## Usage Examples

### Admin Sending Custom Notification
```javascript
// Frontend call
const response = await api.post(`/admin/tickets/${ticketId}/custom-notification/`, {
  message: "We've escalated your issue to our senior team. Expect a resolution within 2 hours."
});
```

### User Receiving Notification
```
Title: "Support Update: TK82569839"
Message: "We've escalated your issue to our senior team. Expect a resolution within 2 hours."
Type: support
Action URL: /help
```

## Integration Points
- ✅ Existing notification system
- ✅ Support ticket system
- ✅ Admin management interface
- ✅ User notification preferences
- ✅ Real-time notification delivery

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications for custom messages
- Template system for common custom messages
- Bulk custom notifications
- Custom notification scheduling
- Rich text formatting support

## Files Modified
1. `backend/api/notification_service.py` - Added custom_reply action
2. `backend/api/admin_ticket_views.py` - Added send_custom_notification function
3. `backend/api/urls.py` - Added custom notification endpoint
4. `web/app/admin/reports/page.tsx` - Added custom reply modal and functionality

## Conclusion
